The application uses Javascript that will start a simple multiple choice trivia game once the start button is clicked. The player is given 30 seconds to answer the questions after which their score will be displayed. 

Highlights
----------
1) The timer works by using the Window objects setInterval method, which calls a function that updates the timers HTML every 1000ms (1 second)
2) Uses jQuery to update the pages HTML and calculate if the selected answers are correct
